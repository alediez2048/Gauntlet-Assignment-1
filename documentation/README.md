# Documentation

All documentation is grouped under `documentation/` by purpose:

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `architecture/` | System design, data flow, state ownership, event contracts |
| `requirements/` | PRD, ticket scopes, and acceptance criteria |
| `testing/` | Testing strategy, per-ticket checklists, tooling guides |
| `agents/` | Agent context and assistant operating notes |
| `reference/` | Supporting references (methodology, AI workflow, cost analysis) |
| `tickets/` | Tracker, development log, and ticket primers |
